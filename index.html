      <h1>HyungCheol Kim</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is HyungCheol Kim, and I’m a 4th year Biomedical Engineering student at UC Irvine, specializing in Biophotonics. I’m passionate about designing and prototyping innovative medical devices to improve the lives of people.
        </p>
        <p>Last summer, I had the opportunity to work as a Process Engineering Intern at Applied Medical on the Fine Fusion line. This experience gave me valuable exposure to all stages of medical device development, from design to manufacturing. This helped me to solidify my interest in product design, process optimization, and collaboration.</p>
        <p>At UCI, I’m currently working on REACH, my senior design project focused on developing a rehabilitative device for stroke survivors. In addition, I also work in CERVOS, in this lab I use silicone molding techniques to develop a novel pessary device that addresses women’s health.</p>
        <p>Outside of engineering, I enjoy working out at the gym, snowboarding, and woodworking.</p>
        <p>With experiences in both hands-on engineering and creative design, I’m excited to seek out new opportunities to learn more!

            <h3>CERVOS LAB</h3>
            <p>AIn the CERVOS Lab, we’re developing an inflatable silicone pessary that continuously adapts to cervical changes in women with cervical incompetence to minimize premature birth and miscarriages. By adjusting to the changing pressures in the cervix, the device maintains support throughout pregnancy resulting in improved patient outcome.

            <h3>UCI BitHacks 2025 </h3>
            <p>In this 36-hour Hackathon, my team and I created an Emotional Support Pet or ESP for short. Powered using an ESP32, this pet tracks your movement, recognizes your face, and responds to touch. We designed this pet to be an accessible alternative to a traditional pet in the goals of brightening the user’s day.</p>

            <p>The goal of Guidance Glasses is to assist visually impaired people in being able to safely cross the street. The glasses use a combination of information provided by the camera, and microphone to assess whether it's safe to cross the street and communicate to the user through haptic feedback.</p>
